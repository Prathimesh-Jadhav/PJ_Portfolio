        github: "https://github.com/Prathimesh-Jadhav/Tracksy",
        projectLink: "https://tracksy-theta.vercel.app/",
        challenge: "Keeping track of available product quantities manually is inefficient and error-prone. Without real-time alerts, shopkeepers risk running out of stock and losing sales. Additionally, replenishment becomes reactive rather than proactive when there's no reliable prediction of product performance and demand trends.",
        solution: "Developed a smart inventory management system that provides real-time stock level updates, low-stock alerts, and predictive analytics based on past sales data. The system helps shopkeepers restock on time and make data-driven purchasing decisions, reducing both overstock and stockouts.",
